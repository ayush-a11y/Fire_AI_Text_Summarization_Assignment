Briefly explaining, BART is a denoising autoencoder that employs the strategy of distorting the input text in many ways, such as blanking out some words and flipping them around, and then learning to reconstruct it. BART has outperformed established models like RoBERTa and BERT on multiple NLP benchmarks, and it is especially efficient in summarization tasks, due to its ability to generate text and learn the context of the input text."

        "One of the quantitative metrics we can employ to evaluate performance is the ROUGE Score. It is considered one of the best metrics for text summarization and it evaluates performance by comparing the quality of a machine-generated summary to a human-generated summary used for reference.\n",

        "The similarities between both summaries are measured by analyzing the overlapping n-grams, either single words or sequences of words that are present in both summaries. These can be unigrams (ROUGE-1), where only the overlap of sole words is measured; bigrams (ROUGE-2), where we measure the overlap of two-word sequences; trigrams (ROUGE-3), where we measure the overlap of three-word sequences; etc. Besides that, we also have:\n",

        "• ROUGE-S: It evaluates the overlap of skip-bigrams, which are bigrams that permit gaps between words. This helps to measure the coherence of a machine-generated summary. For example, in the phrase \"this apple is absolutely green\", we find a match for the terms such as \"apple\" and \"green\", if that is what we are looking for.\n"

        "She wrote on Facebook that “despite outliving every dog in history, his 11,478 days on earth would never be enough, for those who loved him.”\n",
        "There were many secrets to Bobi’s extraordinary old age, his owner Leonel Costa told GWR in February. He always roamed freely, without a leash or chain, lived in a “calm, peaceful” environment and ate human food soaked in water to remove seasonings, Costa said.\n",
        "He spent his whole life in Conqueiros, a small Portuguese village about 150 kilometers (93 miles) north of the capital Lisbon, often wandering around with cats.\n",
        "Bobi was a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo – a breed of livestock guardian dog – according to his owner. Rafeiro do Alentejos have a life expectancy of about 12-14 years, according to the American Kennel Club.\n",
        "But Bobi lived more than twice as long as that life expectancy, surpassing an almost century-old record to become the oldest living dog and the oldest dog ever – a title which had previously been held by Australian cattle-dog Bluey, who was born in 1910 and lived to be 29 years and five months old.\n",
        "However, Bobi’s story almost had a different ending.\n",
        "When he and his three siblings were born in the family’s woodshed, Costa’s father decided they already had too many animals at home.\n",
        "Costa and his brothers thought their parents had taken all the puppies away to be destroyed. However, a few sad days later, they found Bobi alive, safely hidden in a pile of logs.\n",
        "The children hid the puppy from their parents and, by the time Bobi’s existence became known, he was too old to be put down and went on to live his record-breaking life.\n",
