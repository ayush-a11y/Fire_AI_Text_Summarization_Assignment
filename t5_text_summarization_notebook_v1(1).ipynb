        "There mutiple models and also the ditlled model are present but I used the T5 model. Briefly explaining, T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) converts all NLP tasks into a unified \"text-to-text\" format, meaning that every task—whether it's translation, classification, or summarization—is framed as generating a target sequence from an input sequence. This uniform approach makes T5 highly flexible and efficient for multi-task learning and transfer learning. One key advantage of T5 is that it has different model sizes (from T5-small to T5-xxl), allowing for more scalable performance depending on the computational resources available."

        "She wrote on Facebook that “despite outliving every dog in history, his 11,478 days on earth would never be enough, for those who loved him.”\n",
        "There were many secrets to Bobi’s extraordinary old age, his owner Leonel Costa told GWR in February. He always roamed freely, without a leash or chain, lived in a “calm, peaceful” environment and ate human food soaked in water to remove seasonings, Costa said.\n",
        "He spent his whole life in Conqueiros, a small Portuguese village about 150 kilometers (93 miles) north of the capital Lisbon, often wandering around with cats.\n",
        "Bobi was a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo – a breed of livestock guardian dog – according to his owner. Rafeiro do Alentejos have a life expectancy of about 12-14 years, according to the American Kennel Club.\n",
        "But Bobi lived more than twice as long as that life expectancy, surpassing an almost century-old record to become the oldest living dog and the oldest dog ever – a title which had previously been held by Australian cattle-dog Bluey, who was born in 1910 and lived to be 29 years and five months old.\n",
        "However, Bobi’s story almost had a different ending.\n",
        "When he and his three siblings were born in the family’s woodshed, Costa’s father decided they already had too many animals at home.\n",
        "Costa and his brothers thought their parents had taken all the puppies away to be destroyed. However, a few sad days later, they found Bobi alive, safely hidden in a pile of logs.\n",
        "The children hid the puppy from their parents and, by the time Bobi’s existence became known, he was too old to be put down and went on to live his record-breaking life.\n",
